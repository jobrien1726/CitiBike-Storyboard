# tableau-challenge

My original plan for this assignemnt was to download 12 months worth of the 2019 citibike data and combine it all into a single csv file to be used in Tableau. After a significant amount of work creating visualizations with the data in Tableau, I realized a data file this large wuld not be able to save to Tableau Public. I also realized I could not push it to my remote repository. I tried to cut my data down to only 4 months, but struggled with the same issues. Ultimately, I had to switch to one month of data, and this one month needed to be smaller than the other months I was using. So I changed my data to the file that is currently in this repository, and started from scratch with my Tableau work. I didn't want my progress thus far to be completely in vain, so I kept my jupyter notebook file where I initially combined all the individual monthly data. And I'm copying the links to my original datasets here.
